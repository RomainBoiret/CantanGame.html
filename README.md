## Project Overview

This web-based version of _Catan_ allows players to compete against each other in a local multiplayer environment. The game is played offline, meaning players only need a single device to play together. It is implemented using **Vue.js** and is entirely client-side.

The game will be deployed on **GitHub Pages**, making it easy to access and play without any hosting or server requirements.

## Game Mechanics

For those unfamiliar with _Catan_, players collect resources like wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore by building settlements near resource tiles. These resources are then used to build roads, settlements, and cities to expand their reach and earn victory points. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a set number of victory points through building, trading, and strategy.

For a detailed explanation of the rules, please refer to <ins>the rules page</ins> (link coming soon).

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js** – A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – Standard web technologies used to structure and style the game.

## How to Play

The game is simple to access and play:

1. Navigate to the **GitHub Pages** deployment (link to be added).
2. Start a new game and follow the on-screen prompts to set up players.
3. Play with others by taking turns on the same device, interacting through a click-based interface.

Since this is a static site, no hosting or server setup is required. Simply open the game in a browser and start playing!
